# Welcome to Quetzal

Quetzal is the theme behind TabbedOut wikis generating the core look and function of the sites.

By default, our wikis using Quetzal should be capable of generating simple, organized, and easily traversable collections of pages. Additions made past the core theme should largely attempt not to clash with it, for example, shortcodes and CSS variables that give the site a unique look without being difficult to maintain.

Any additions that prove to be significant can and should be eventually adapted to the core theme here. Similarly, the theme itself should be constantly improved to make important overrides easy.
